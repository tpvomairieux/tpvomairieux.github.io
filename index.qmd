## About Me

Hi! I'm Phu, a Sophmore at Pomona College. I'm originally
from Nha Trang, Vietnam, but live in the states now (Richmond, VA).
One of my greatest passions in life is music.
I didn't have the opportunity growing up, but after getting
a job, I've been able to buy the instruments
and have been learning guitar, piano, and ukulele.
I'm taking voice lessons at Pomona currently! You'll find
my Spotify linked below my profile picture, if you're interested
in what music I listen to. Because music is such a big part of
my life, I decided to do my TidyTuesday analyses on Eurovision
and Spotify statistics. Hope you enjoy my short page!
