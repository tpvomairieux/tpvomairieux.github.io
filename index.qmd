## About Me

Hi! I'm Phu, a Sophmore at Pomona College. I'm originally from Nha Trang, Vietnam, but live in the states now (Richmond, VA). I can play guitar, piano, and ukelele, and am learning how to sing! If you want to see what i'm listening to currently, you can find my Spotify linked below my profile picture. I hope we can bond over music! Hope you enjoy my short page!
