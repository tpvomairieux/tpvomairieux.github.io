# DS Project 1

For some reason, after submission, I went to check the uploaded website, and it had stopped working. I spent a bit debugging (see my commit labels) and realized that my gitignore file prevented my files from pushing my local /docs to the github /docs. However, this doesn't really make sense, as it was working before. All of a sudden, I got error 404. I'm not too sure what happened, but after debugging, it's working now.
