## Introduction

**Quantifying Emily Dickinson’s Poetry**

- Full-text analysis of all poems from the DickinsonPoems R package  
- Goal: identify stylistic patterns using text processing and regular expressions  
- Focus areas:
  - Vocabulary patterns
  - Punctuation behavior
  - Death-related expressions
  - Personal language (“my …”)

This analysis studies how Dickinson writes across her entire body of work, rather than interpreting individual poems.

---

## Original Analysis

### Version 1 Overview
- Used regular expressions to extract:
  - Death-related vocabulary
  - Year-like numbers (four digits)
  - Words following “my” through lookbehind
- Plotted:
  - Most frequent word counts
  - Relationship between poem length and punctuation count
  
---

### Original Code

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(knitr)

knitr::include_graphics("media/ogtokenize.png")

```

---

### Limitations
- Raw frequency reflected common English usage rather than poetic style  
- Contractions created fragmented tokens (e.g., isolated letters from “don’t”)  
- Stop words dominated results, masking meaningful language patterns

The original analysis measured language structure rather than poetic meaning.


---

### Original Output

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
knitr::include_graphics("media/ogresult.png")

```

---

## New Analysis

### Refinements in Version 2
- Cleaned text by removing:
  - Contractions
  - Apostrophes and possessive endings
  - One-letter fragments
- Removed stop words such as common pronouns, articles, and auxiliary verbs
- Focused on meaningful tokens with semantic weight

---

### Updated Code

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("media/newcode.png")

```

---

### Key Findings

The most frequent words after filtering are small, transitional, and suggestive:

- little
- will
- till
- away
- day
- life

These words emphasize boundaries, anticipation, and measurement.

---

### New Output

```{r}
#| echo: false


knitr::include_graphics("media/newoutputd.png")

```

---

## Semantic Interpretation

### Poetic Functions of Common Words

| Word | Function |
|------|----------|
| little | Attention to smallness, precision, measured perception |
| day / life | Boundaries, duration, temporal framing |
| till / will | Anticipation, incompleteness, deferred action |
| away | Distance, separation, loss, withdrawal |

Dickinson creates intensity not through elaborate vocabulary, but through partial states and restricted language. She builds meaning by holding back, delaying, or measuring experience.

## Punctuation Analysis

### Poem Length and Punctuation Frequency

Observations:
- Longer poems generally contain more punctuation
- However, there is significant variation beyond the predicted trend

Punctuation functions stylistically rather than mechanically. In many poems, punctuation marks (particularly dashes) serve as rhythmic and expressive devices that shape hesitation, emphasis, and tone.

---

### Original Code

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("media/codepunc.png")

```
---

### Output

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(knitr)

knitr::include_graphics("media/newoutputpunc.png")

```

---

## Future Work

Possible extensions of this analysis include:

- Separate classification of em dashes distinct from other punctuation
- Topic modeling to group poems by thematic patterns such as death, nature, faith, or memory
- Sentiment analysis across lines to measure emotional movement within poems
- Temporal comparison of early and late poems to detect stylistic changes

These approaches would support a deeper computational interpretation of Dickinson’s writing.
