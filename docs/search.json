I didn’t have the opportunity growing up, but after getting a job, I’ve been able to buy the instruments and have been learning guitar, piano, and ukulele. I’m taking voice lessons at Pomona currently! You’ll find my Spotify linked below my profile picture, if you’re interested in what music I listen to. Because music is such a big part of my life, I decided to do my TidyTuesday analyses on Eurovision and Spotify statistics. Hope you enjoy my short page!"

Sweden dominates the charts with 5669 points, followed by Ukraine with 4998 and Russia with 3977. Norway, Greece, Azerbaijan, and Moldova show solid performances in their Eurovision entries. In particular, Azerbaijan only entered the competition in 2008, so 3 years late, but is 6th in total accumulated points, with 3528– an extraordinary result.The following countries are followed by Serbia, then the Netherlands, and lastly Bulgaria, with 2945 points. Eastern European countries dominate the charts, which is surprising, given that the Eurovision “Big-Five,” all Western European countries (U.K., Spain, Germany, France, Italy) are now automatically qualified to the finals despite not scoring the highest. Perhaps, it’s time for a new “Big Five?” Or, do the countries not try as hard to score points, knowing that they are guaranteed finalists due to their financial backing of the competition? It is important to acknowledge that there have been some disbanded countries (countries that no longer exist, such as Serbia and Montenegro), or inactive countries, which affect the total accumulated score of the country (especially in a split like Serbia and Montenegro). I decided that it was better to still continue with total accumulated points compared to average points, because Serbia and Montenegro for example participated in a single contest, placed 2nd, and while is obviously an outlier, “rules” the dataset as the best country by average points."

    "text": "Analysis\nInfluenced by party music, I created a horizontal bar chart to show the top 10 artists with tracks that have the highest average danceability. A score of 0 would represent undanceable, and a score of 1 to be extremely danceable. I decided to sort songs by popularities of greater than or equal to 90, because the song has to be “relevant” enough for a college to know and be able to vibe/dance to. Roddy Rich tops the list with the highest average danceability of 0.90 –he’s followed by artists like Dimelo Flow, Lil Uzi Vert, Regard, Rauw Alejandro, and Lil Nas X, with their scores at around 0.90. The above artists are Hip/Hop creators, Reggaeton singers, and DJs, which make sense– the cultural background of the music they create has a strong history of dance and high energy levels. Next, Y2K scored 0.84, Ed Sheeran scored 0.82, Tones and I 0.82, and Nicky Jam 0.82. The results suggest that among mainstream artists, hip-hop, reggaeton, and pop crossovers tend to dominate in term of danceable tracks. It’s important to note that filtering an artist by their top hits only may not accurately represent their music’s danceability. For example, Ed Sheeran has a lot of indie music on top of his pop hits, however, as they aren’t as relevant, the popularity filter does not account for the danceability of those tracks, increasing his score. However, I believe that the parameters still give us a good way to analyze which artists we should be playing to dance. So, the next time I go to a party, or high-octane social event, I better hear one of these artists! Or, we’ll just get some 2010s house again…"

Next, “to” is listed at 656 observations. It’s interesting to note that the next most used word, “I”, is a pronoun, and the only pronoun on the top 10. With 615 uses, it shows that most of Dickinson’s poems are written from first-person perspective or express personal thought and feeling. The rest of the top 10 is “of”, “it”, “in”, “that”, and “is”, with 543, 371, 357, 354, and 329 uses. The list reflects an analysis made by the Oxford English Corpus of the 100 most common words in written English, with 8 of the 10 of Dickinson’s most used words (only is and it are not in the top 10) being in the top 10, and only 1 (is) not being in the top 100. Dickinson, despite her unconventional punctuation and themes, still drew from everyday common English. Her uniqueness and innovation is not in her word choice, but rather her arrangement of words to create a complex story– a poem. Her poetry is accessible, as it uses familiar words, yet is profoundly layered as she explores her own emotions, thoughts, and existential reflections."

In theory, the more lines in a poem, the greater the frequency of punctuation. I decided to use a linear model (method = “lm”) as I believed that the number of lines in a poem should function as a direct explanation for the punctuation count in Dickinson’s poems. While the regression line shows a general upward trend, the data points reveal considerable variation, especially as poem length increases. Most frequently, the longer the poem, Dickinson will use more punctuation than the model predicts she would use. The variation could reflect her unconventional approach to grammar and poetic rhythm, which serve stylistically to contribute to the poem’s tone and emotion. Punctuation in a Dickinson work is not merely just a structural device, but a deliberate choice that reflects the aesthetic and elasticity of her poetry."

    "text": "Narrative\nIn completing this project, I wanted to have a better understanding of Emily Dickinson’s poetic style through a computational lens. While her writing is intensely emotional and personal, known for its introspection and peculiar use of punctuation, it also displays a structural consistency with recurring themes. I wondered if these qualities could be reflected quantitatively through text analysis. By counting word frequency, I was able to explore Dickinson’s vocabulary– interestingly, the most common words in her poetry are simple, everyday English words like “the”, “a”, and “and”. It suggests to me that rather than complex diction, Dickinson’s poetry’s power comes from how she arranges her work to express profound meaning. The presence of “I” supports a common interpretation that her work is self-reflective and personal.\nThe regular expressions I designed further support my question. I tried to detect text from poems which reference words related to death, one of Dickinson’s most enduring themes, and extracted any year-like numbers that might situate her work temporally or support the theme of death and ending. By identifying words that followed “my”, I tried to trace personal/possessive language– all these textual patterns tell the story of how Emily Dickinson engaged with mortality, memory, limit, and subjectivity in her work."

My alternative hypothesis (Ha) says that people born in the latter half of the year, from July-Dec., are more likely to be cranky when compared to the first half of the year people. To derive this, I’ll first use lubridate to derive each villager’s birth month from the birthday variable and categorize them into Jan.-June or July-Dec. Then, I’ll calculate the observed differences in proportions of Cranky villagers between the two halves of the year. I wrote a function to randomly permute birth-half labels, recompute the difference in proportions, and return the value. Then, I used map_dbl() to repeat the process 1,000 times to generate a null-distribution of differences under random label assignment to estimate an empirical p-value by comparing the observed difference to the distribution of permuted differences. The first graph I’ll create shows the proportion of each personality across the two birth halves, to help visualize the observed data. The second graph is a histogram of the permutation distribution which shows what kind of proportion differences that should be expected if there was no true relationship between birth-half and crankiness."

The information comes from Villager DB, which is a community-maintained database that compiles detailed profiles of all Animal Crossing villagers. I am currently unable to access this datasource or locate the individuals that put the data into a presentable form. Both the website VillagerDB and the Github repository are down, and after a quick Reddit search, I learned that they’ve been taken down recently, and I don’t know when it is coming back. For the original data in the game, the data was created by the developers, Nintendo, and the producer who “created” the Animal Crossing games would be Hisashi Nogami. More details about Animal Crossing and characters can be officially sourced to their website."

    "text": "Simulation Details (cont.) (What I did, Results Summary)\nIn this simulation, I performed a permutation test to evaluate whether villagers born in the first half of the year (January–June) were more or less likely to be cranky than those born in the latter half (July–December). After categorizing villagers by their birth month and calculating the observed difference in proportions, I found that the proportion of cranky villagers was higher in the July–December group. The observed difference was approximately −0.0749, meaning the first-half group had about roughly 7.49% fewer cranky villagers on average. To test whether this difference could have arisen by chance, I simulated the null hypothesis by randomly shuffling the birth-half labels 1,000 times using my function one_permutation(), applied through map_dbl(). This generated a null distribution of differences assuming no true association between birth month and personality. The observed difference fell in the tail of this distribution, corresponding to an empirical p-value of approximately 0.039, and as 0.039 &lt; 0.05, it suggests the result is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.\nOverall, the simulation supports the hypothesis that villagers born in the latter half of the year are slightly more likely to be cranky– we should reject Ho, as villagers born from July onwards are more likely to be cranky compared to their earlier born counterparts. Permutation testing can be used to assess non-parametric relationships between categorical variables, and in this case, it appears that people born July and afterwards are indeed more upset than those born from January thru. June ;)."
